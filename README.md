webpack-dev-server demo
=======================

```
npm install
webpack-dev-server --progress --colors
```

Then open <http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/>.

You will see the content of `index.html` wrapped with a message banner, and when any file is changed, webpack-dev-server will recompile it based on `webpack.config.js` and reload the browser automatically.
